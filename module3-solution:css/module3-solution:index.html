          <h2>Chicken</h2>
              Consider for a moment if the dreaded dinnertime conversation went like this: “what’s for dinner?” “Chicken breast.” “Chicken breasts for dinner? YAY!!!”. Well, we’ve rounded up our 60 best chicken breast recipes, all of which are pretty easy, and super delicious. Let’s dive in! Here are 60—yeah, that’s 6-0 easy chicken recipes—ideas for how to cook chicken breast that are anything but boring!Lemon chicken is really just a simple baked chicken recipe, jazzed up with some punchy ingredients that add lots of flavor without taking away from how super-healthy baked chicken breasts are. Our lemon chicken recipe is fast and easy—a recipe you might turn to on a busy weeknight when you need dinner to be simple as it can be. It’s also a great one to include in your weekend meal-prep (if you do that kind of thing) because one of the many reasons we love lemon chicken breasts is their versatility. Having a container of them in the fridge, all baked and ready to go, means you’ve got the makings of lots of meals! They can anchor a simple and healthy lunch salad, and are delicious sliced up into hearty sandwiches—ones where the bread is slathered with mayo and Homemade Pesto—for dinner, too.Ingredients laid out for Lemon chicken, chicken breast, lemon, olive oil, lemon juice, brown sugar, garlic, spices in a bowl with olive oil
